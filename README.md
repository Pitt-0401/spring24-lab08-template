# LAB08 - Template

Please see problem statement/slides.

## Task1: Sort the cat array by age (QuickSort and MergeSort)
- Take some time to understand the template code
- Complete the template code (there are TODOs)
- Print the cats to check whether they were sorted (by age)

## Task2: Search for a cat
- Implement a class BinarySearch with a method "searchForCat()" that searches for a specific cat object, given an input (key)
- Implement a BinarySearch algorithm
- Return the found cat or outputs an expressive error message
- Optional: If you found multiple cats, add the cats to an array
